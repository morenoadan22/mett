<p>Graduate students selecting Plan B must pass three of five possible written comprehensive exams. Students can select any three exams of Automata-Formal language, Data Structures-Algorithms, Numerical Analysis, Operating Systems-Architecture, and Programming Languages. The syllabi for the material covered on each exam is available on line by selecting the exam above. Copies of previous exams are available at Cal Copy, 5131 College Avenue; call 619-582-9949 for hours.</p>

<p>Students are allowed three attempts to pass each local exam. That is, students can take up to three tries on each of the local exams. However, the (non-local!) GRE Computer Science subject exam has no limit on the number of attempts.  **Note the GRE CS subject exam is being discontinued by ETS after April 2013**</p>

<p>Deadline to register for exams is one week before the exam is offered. No exceptions. Students can start signing up for the fall exams on August 1 and the spring exams on December 5. If a student cannot take an exam they must cancel at least one week before the exam is offered. If the cancellation is not done on time, the test will count as an attempt at the exam scheduled even if the student does not take the exam.</p>
